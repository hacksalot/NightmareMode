A "nightmare" game mode for Oxygen Not Included.

Nightmare Mode introduces a new game mode in which difficulty levels are maximized (by default; difficulty levels can be adjusted/lowered) and [b]the ability to load into a previous save game is removed[/b]. Instead, Nightmare Mode maintains a single save file representing the most recent state of your Nightmare colony. Since there’s no ability to load into a previous save, decisions made in Nightmare Mode and the consequences for those decisions are permanent.
