[h2]Features[/h2]

- Adds a Nightmare Mode option to the new game flow, replacing Casual Mode.
- Optionally ramps up new game difficulties (for nightmare games) to maximum. You can change the difficulty settings at any time.
- Optionally prevents loading of prior saves (aka "save scumming" or "rewinding").
- Optionally performs autosave at key inflection points such as duplicant death.
- Optionally allow and disallow certain mods.
- Degrades gracefully. Nightmare games are still playable if you uninstall Nightmare Mode.
- Vanilla-compatible. Introduces no in-game items or gameplay tweaks.

[h2]Updates for v1.1.0[/h2]

- Support for cloud saves and the Spaced Out! DLC.
- No longer modifies Oxygen Not Included save files. In previous versions, the Nightmare Mode mod appended some data to the end of each Nightmare Mode save game file. This behavior has been changed to store Nightmare Mode metadata externally.

All settings are adjustable and apply only to Nightmare Mode games. Non-nightmare colonies are unaffected by this mod.
