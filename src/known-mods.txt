# ==============
#
# List your mods here along with a difficulty cost, negative or positive.
# Nightmare Mode will incorporate your mods into its 0-100+ difficulty rating.
#
# If the mod makes the game EASIER, either by adding a new building or creature
# or adjusting the gameplay, you should assign it a *negative* cost. Enabling
# this mod while playing Nightmare Mode will result in a LOWER overall difficulty
# rating.
#
# If the mod makes the game HARDER, whether by removing key functionality or
# tweaking existing items and/or systems, you should assign it a positive cost.
# Enabling this mod while playing Nightmare Mode will result in a HIGHER
# overall difficulty rating.
#
# Quality-of-life mods that don't alter the rules or nouns of the game should
# be assigned a cost of zero (0).
